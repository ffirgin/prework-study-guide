# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


My motivation for this project was to have a well structured webpage to reference back to with any notes that I've taken. I built this project so that I can find and read the notes and information I've taken. This solves the need for having to go and look through previous lessons to find information that is helpful for further projects. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, including several details through each of these subjects.
